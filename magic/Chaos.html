            <p class="cleared uncentered"><bold>Chaos magic</bold> is a type of spiritual magic. It is also considered a flowing magic. About 5% of bodies in Karvaea have a magical bias towards chaos magic.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">There are four primary abilities related to chaos magic:</p>
            <ul class="uncentered">
                <li>Inceptor flame</li>
                <li>Precognition</li>
                <li>Reality distortion</li>
                <li>Telepathy</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="uncentered">In the past, those who preconceived disasters were believed to also be the ones to later cause them with their magic. This led to chaos magic previously being referred to as "disaster magic." Over time, this term has fallen out of use and become something of a pejorative.</p>
