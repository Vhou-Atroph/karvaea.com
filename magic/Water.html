            <p class="cleared uncentered"><bold>Water magic</bold> is a type of basic elemental magic. It is also considered a flowing magic, though some magicians dispute this. About 27% of bodies in Karvaea have a magical bias towards earth magic. It is the most common magical bias.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">There are two primary abilities related to water magic:</p>
            <ul class="uncentered">
                <li>Hydrokinesis</li>
                <li>Magical healing</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="uncentered">In colder weather, water magic's hydrokinesis can become cryokinesis.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">In addition to its primary uses, water magic has some application in creating hybrid elemental magic. When combined with earth magic, it can create nature magic. When combined with wind and optionally electricity magic, it can create storm magic.</p>
