                <h1>Welcome to Karvaea.com</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the internet home of <bold>Karvaea</bold>!</p>
                <p>Karvaea is a fantasy world created by VhouAtroph. The first notes for the world were written on April 10th 2022 as a place to dump fantasy concepts that had no other place in the author's other worlds. But, over time, the world has significantly grown in scope. Karvaea now has its own history, a relatively hard magic system, a world map with several regions, and several species that inhabit the world. This website should serve as an official place to find information about the world of Karvaea, as well as some stories that take place in it.</p>
                <p>This website is currently under construction, but still feel free to navigate around to explore what there is to offer so far! It currently isn't mobile friendly at all, but that'll get sorted out eventually probably.</p>
