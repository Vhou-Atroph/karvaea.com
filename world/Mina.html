            <p class="cleared uncentered"><bold>Mina</bold> is a region in the western hemisphere of Karvaea. It is connected to the Lilieaeta by sea. No people permanently inhabit the Mina, and it is the smallest region in the world.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">The island of Mina consists largely of a sandy desert which has been found to predate much of the rest of Karvaea. This has made it quite of interest to researchers, who frequently visit the region.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">Creatures in Mina have largely adopted a burrowing lifestyle, leaving much of the surface appear to look rather devoid of life. With much of these creatures seeming to adopt a fish-like body plan to swim beneath the sands, some have joked that Mina just happens to be a sandier part of the ocean.</p>
