            <p class="cleared uncentered">The <bold>South Calla Ocean</bold> is an ocean that lies south of mainland Petiola, Calla, Dolos, and Drosera. Godspine and parts of Petiola are also considered to be a part of the South Calla Ocean. It is considered to be the coldest of the four oceans.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">There are some criticisms of the naming of the South Calla Ocean being slightly confusing. Some argue that the body of water should simply be named the South Ocean, because it does not actually encompass the area that Calla is located in. Those who are in favor of the ocean's current name believe it makes perfect sense because it is the ocean south of Calla.</p>
