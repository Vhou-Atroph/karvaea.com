            <p class="cleared uncentered"><bold>Tiptop Ocean</bold> is an ocean that lies north of Sanguinal, the Lilieaeta, Mina, Dragonmaw, Antiri, Dayglare, and Drosera. Prosos and the Arisaerel are also considered to be a part of Tiptop Ocean. It is considered to be the lowest in salinity of the four oceans.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">Tiptop Ocean has a particularly large number of icebergs that float in it, with the largest concentration of these being around the Arisaerel. This has made travel in the area rather difficult, with only the most experienced captains daring enough to brave the waters.</p>
