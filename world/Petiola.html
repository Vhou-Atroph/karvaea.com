            <p class="cleared uncentered"><bold>Petiola</bold> is a region in the western hemisphere of Karvaea. It is connected to Aquatos and Sanguinal by sea. It is the most populated region on the western hemisphere, and among the largest.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">There are three major islands that make up Petiola. The largest is simply named Petiola, and is the namesake of the region. The next largest is a donut shaped island named Yubiñu, and the smallest of the three is named Throlik. Petiola and Yuniñu are inhabited, but Throlik is not.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">Petiola exists in the most climactic zones out of any other region in Karvaea, with the most northern parts of the region having a tropical climate, and the most southern parts of the region having a polar climate. This range in climate is among the reasons Petiola has become so popular over time.</p>
