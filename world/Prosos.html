            <p class="cleared uncentered"><bold>Prosos</bold> is a region in the western hemisphere of Karvaea. It is connected to the Arisaerel, the Lilieaeta, and Sanguinal by sea. It has a fair population.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">The boreal forests of Prosos are some of the most impressive in all of Karvaea. The region is home to some of the best wood in the world, though this has also led to a logging problem. Many places in Prosos have created programs to incentivize tree replanting, which has been turned into a way to draw in tourists to the region. Those who assist in the replanting of trees can be awarded collectable stickers or a certificate for their efforts.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">Aramum is the northernmost town of Prosos, and is often used as a checkpoint for travelers to get any final supplies they may need for a trip into the Arisaerel. Those who use it as such are often asked if they plan on returning to the town later for a discounted tree replanting tour. This offer is taken very frequently.</p>
