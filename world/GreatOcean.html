            <p class="cleared uncentered">The <bold>Great Ocean</bold> is an ocean that lies east of Prosos, Sanguinal, and Petiola mainland, and west of Antiri and Drosera. Calla, Dolos, Dragonmaw, Mina, and the Lilieaeta are also considered to be a part of the Great Ocean. It is considered to be the largest of the four oceans.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">Most activity of the fishing industry in Karvaea happens in the Great Ocean, though much of this is owed to the fact a majority of the major seafaring societies are next to this body of water. Leviathan hunting is also most common in the Great Ocean, with most of these species spending some time of the year in these waters.</p>
