            <p class="cleared uncentered"><bold>Godspine</bold> is a region in both the eastern and western hemispheres of Karvaea. It is not directly connected to any other region by land or sea. There are a small number of people who live in Godspine, with most of them living on the northeastern peninsula. Godspine is the southernmost region in Karvaea.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">People often come to Godspine as a form of training to prepare for trips to the Arisaerel. The region is considered somewhat safer than the Arisaerel because although they share many similarities such as a colder climate, Godspine is continually inhabited while the Arisaerel is not.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">Madlen Mountain, the tallest mountain throughout all of Karvaea, is located within the Godspine Mountains in the center of the region. The mountain is believed to be named after a legendary mountain climber.</p>
