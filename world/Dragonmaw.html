            <p class="cleared uncentered"><bold>Dragonmaw</bold> is a region in the western hemisphere of Karvaea. It is not directly connected to any other region by land or sea. Dragonmaw has a fair population, with most living on the outskirts of the island.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">The central volcano of Dragonmaw is known as Mount Vere√±a. There have been no large eruptions in recent history, though the volcano does have many frequent smaller eruptions.</p>
            <p class="uncentered">Because of all the volcanic activity on Dragonmaw, the region has some of the most nutrient rich soil in all of Karvaea. This has made dragonin soil a commodity throughout other regions, although it is also illegal to transport without a permit. This has not stopped the soil from becoming highly traded in black markets.</p>
